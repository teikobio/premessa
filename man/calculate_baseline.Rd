\title{Calculate baseline for normalization}
\usage{
calculate_baseline(
  wd,
  beads.type,
  files.type = c("data", "beads"),
  beads.gates = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{wd}{Working directory (character)}

\item{beads.type}{Type of beads. Must be one of \code{"Fluidigm"}, \code{"Beta"}, \code{"XT"}}

\item{files.type}{The type of FCS files contained in \code{wd}. If \code{data}, the files represent
full datasets (i.e. beads + cells events), the gates in \code{beads.gates} will be applied to extract
the beads, and the median intensity of the beads events will be returned to be used as baseline
for normalization. If \code{beads}, the files are assumed to only contain beads events. The
\code{beads.gates} parameter is ignored, and the median of all the beads events (i.e. the entire
content of the files) will be returned.}

\item{beads.gates}{Gates to identify the beads. This is a data structure with the following format
\code{list(file_name = list(channel_name = list(x = [xMin, xMax], y = [yMin, yMax]), ...), ...)}.
Note that only files in \code{names(beads.gates)} will be processed. Also note that the data structure
may contain gates for extra channels, but which channels will be used depends on the \code{beads.type} parameter}
}
\value{
Returns a vector with the medians of the beads events across all processed files
}
\description{
Extract beads events from all the FCS files in the working directory
and calculates the baseline for normalization
